a: The family feud game must include:
    1. The ability for the SGA to easily change the questions/data. This could be accomplished by having a seperate .exe file that provides an interface
     to change the questions and answers, or with a setup screen that runs at the start of each game.
    2. The ability to create two different teams, and track and display their scores.
    3. The ability for the users to participate in the head-to-head buzzer question to decide who answers the rest of the questions. From here, we should
     be able to easily select the team that won.
    4. The ability to display all of the answers on the board, and easily reveal them by clicking on them.
    5. The ability to press a given button (maybe x?) and give the team a strike for a wrong answer
